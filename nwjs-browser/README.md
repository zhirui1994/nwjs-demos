# nwjs Browser Framework
You can use this "framework" to quickly and easily start your own browser or use it as a custom wrapper for a website which you wish to have some custom control over, like hiding the address bar, but keeping other navigational tools. Please feel free to fork and submit pull requests with features you think would be nice to have. This uses the [DBAD License](https://github.com/philsturgeon/dbad).


### Basic use

Obviously, this is for use with [nwjs](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js). Edit the config for basic customiztions.

    {
        "homepage": "google.com",
        "name": "nw.js browser framework",
        "showDevTools":false,
        "header":{
            "back":true,
            "forward":true,
            "refresh":true,
            "dev":true,
            "address":true
        },
        "proxy":true
    }
    
|  config key | expects |  what it does |
|----|----|----|
|homepage|url|sets the page which the browser will open on launch|
|name|string|name to show in the application header/chrome|
|showDevTools|bool|open the nwjs devtools for the whole app, not just the web page|
|header.back|bool|shows the back button for navigating to the previous page|
|header.forward|bool|shows the forward button for navigating to the next page in the history|
|header.refresh|bool|shows the refresh button to reload the current page|
|header.dev|bool|shows the dev tools button allowing dev tools for ***ONLY*** the webpage, this does ***NOT*** give access to your nw browser dev tools. Just the website.|
|proxy|bool|uses very basic [web proxy](http://www.webproxy.net/) to route communications. Just a quick way to hide your IP, some sites might not like it though. |
